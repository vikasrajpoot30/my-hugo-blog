I remember when I first read *The Alchemist*, it took me only one sitting to complete it. It was a page-turner that hooked me with its flow. It’s not a very common novel, or I must say a classical fiction story; instead, it’s a story of everyone’s journey.

It talks about the journey of finding oneself. We are all the same regardless of where we live or what language we speak; we are all one! Santiago is a boy who dreams of traveling across the desert to see the Pyramids and wants to find his “treasure.” This treasure is nothing but finding the *Personal Legend*.

I have read *The Alchemist* multiple times and even listened to the audiobook many times, yet every time it feels like a fresh journey. *The Alchemist* was written in 1988 by Paulo Coelho, but it feels like a story from yesterday. I don’t remember the time when it became my favorite book, or I should say, it became a part of my life journey; I couldn’t recall the exact moment.

So, if you think you need to go on a long journey with yourself, do consider picking up this book and giving it a chance.
